## Built With

- `React` : version 18.2.0
- `React Router` : version 6.4.5
- `Vite` : version 3.2.3
- `Firebase` : version 9.15.0
- `Material-UI` : version 11.10.5

## Features

- Impremented authentication system and stored user info and their post datas with Firebase.


## Challenging Part

- The part that manages routing rules in React router depends on the user authentication status checked by Firebase. I was able to know how to make a Multi-Page Application and deepen my understanding of React Router, especially how `Private Routes` works.


## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start running the app


## Status

This app is still in progress to be updated! Planning to add posts delete feature.
