## Built With

- `React` : version 18.2.0
- `React Router` : version 6.4.5
- `Vite` : version 3.2.3
- `Firebase` : version 9.15.0
- `Material-UI` : version 11.10.5

## Features

- Impremented authentication system and stored user info and post datas with Firebase

## Challenging Part

- How managing routing rules in React router depending on user authentication status checked by Firebase was hard to figure out.
I tried to understand the Firebase documentation to solve this, and also organized the folder structure in a practical way.
I was able to learn the process of making a Multi-Page Application through the project.

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start running the app

## Status

This app is still in progress to be updated! Planning to add posts delete feature.
